Before the class, send participants an introductory email. Here is some sample text.

This workshop will be primarily lecture style, with some class activities. To participate, you'll need a laptop and a set of headphones. If you don't have access to a laptop, please let me know; we may be able to bring an extra for you. In class, we will be trying a screenreader simulation that requires the Adobe Shockwave plugin. To save yourself some time, you might want to go to http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/welcome/ and check to see if you have the plugin installed. 

I will also be demonstrating the built-in Apple screenreader, VoiceOver. If you have an iDevices (iPod touch, iPhone, iPad), you might want to bring it along. 

When setting up the class, write on the board or post clearly in room:
Name, contact information

Optionally, an iDevice (iPhone, iPod, iPad) to demonstrate VoiceOver. You can find a good intro to VoiceOver at http://examples.oreilly.com/9780596804299/voiceover-free-bonus-appendix.pdf.
